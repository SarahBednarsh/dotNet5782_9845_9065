Hello World!
to check later: do we need to put thisses in the constructer functions?


DAL: remember to add basic logic for handling the data lists!!!
cooridinates: combine longitude and latitude-create a class in DAL(we think), define a method calcDis which gets another location and returns distance, and combine lattitude and longitude everywhere-call them location
DONE initialize: change to Datetime.minval
BL: exceptions, tostrings
DAL: exceptions
BO: figure out what should be in bo and what not

Sarah: fix DroneToList, finish dealing with drones, add basic login in DAL- if in search drone doesn't exist return -1 and so on 
Liorah: add cooridnates, fix initialize

Liorah: fixed Location. should fix the IBL constructor. (consider using ligical entities instead of DAL entities)

Questions for Nurit:
1) how do we update things in dal- do we make a functions for each? or a function ans send all the parameters? or have a function that we each time enter different variables?
2)


May the odds be ever in our favor :)

Notes:
1. fix calcDis
2. Organize targil1? optional
3. Break BL constructor down to funcs
4. Remove methods from Location
5. Empty input - how to handle
6. Delete unnecessary funcs from ibl
7. Also change sexagesimal - delete funcs, etc.
