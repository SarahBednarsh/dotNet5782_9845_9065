Hello World!
to check later: do we need to put thisses in the constructer functions?


DAL: remember to add basic logic for handling the data lists!!!
cooridinates: combine longitude and latitude-create a class in DAL(we think), define a method calcDis which gets another location and returns distance, and combine lattitude and longitude everywhere-call them location
initialize: change to Datetime.minval
BL: exceptions, tostrings
DAL: exceptions


Sarah: fix DroneToList, finish dealing with drones, add basic login in DAL- if in search drone doesn't exist return -1 and so on 
Liorah: add cooridnates, fix initialize

Liorah: fixed coordinates. should fix the IBL constructor. (consider using ligical entities instead of DAL entities)

May the odds be ever in our favor :)
